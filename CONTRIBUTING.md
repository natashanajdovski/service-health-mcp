## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+**
- **TypeScript 5+**
- **Git**
- **Claude Desktop** (for testing)

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/service-health-mcp.git
   cd service-health-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a development branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

4. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start  # Test that server starts correctly
   ```

5. **Test with Claude Desktop**
   - Add your development version to Claude Desktop config
   - Test that tools work correctly
   - Verify no regressions in existing functionality

## üîç Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- **Use strict TypeScript** - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Follow existing patterns** - look at current code structure
- **Add proper type definitions** for new interfaces
- **Use meaningful variable names** - prefer clarity over brevity

### Security Requirements
- **Maintain SSRF protection** - never allow internal network access
- **Validate all inputs** - use Zod schemas for validation
- **Follow secure coding practices** - no hardcoded secrets, proper error handling
- **Test security features** - ensure your changes don't bypass protections

### Code Style
- **Use existing formatting** - follow the project's TypeScript/ESLint configuration
- **Write self-documenting code** - clear function and variable names
- **Add comments for complex logic** - especially security-related code
- **Keep functions focused** - single responsibility principle

### Error Handling
- **Provide meaningful error messages** - help users understand what went wrong
- **Use proper TypeScript error types** - avoid generic Error objects where possible
- **Log appropriately** - helpful for debugging but don't leak sensitive info
- **Fail gracefully** - don't crash the entire server on individual request errors

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
Before submitting, please test:

1. **Basic functionality**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Claude Desktop integration**
   - Add to config and restart Claude Desktop
   - Test basic health checks: `"Check if google.com is healthy"`
   - Test error cases: `"Check if localhost is healthy"` (should be blocked)

3. **Edge cases**
   - Invalid URLs
   - Network timeouts
   - Different HTTP methods
   - Custom headers

### Automated Testing
We welcome contributions to improve our test coverage:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for MCP protocol
- Security tests for SSRF protection
